Demo Plan: Posts, Replies, Likes (Updated)

Goal: Make creating posts, replying, and liking/unliking reliable for a live demo, with visible persistence and basic counts.

Current State Summary
- Posts: `postService.createPost` is wired via `ComposeModal`; feed loads posts via `postService.getTimeline`/`getUserPosts`. Post enrichment (author/stats/interactions) runs async after transform, which may not trigger a React re-render.
- Replies: Replies are modeled as posts with `replyToId`; `postService.getReplies` exists. UI opens compose as a reply, but there’s no post-detail thread and reply counts are inaccurate (count limited to 1 in `countReplies`).
- Likes: Backend service (`likeService`) now uses typed `likes` document instance for like/unlike and queries (converts base58 postId to bytes). UI persists; initial liked state still loaded per post.

Recent changes
- Added codegen: `contracts/contract-to-ts.mjs` generates `lib/contract-types.generated.ts`.
- Added `lib/contract-api.ts` with `DataContract`, `DocumentType` and strict index‑aware where typing.
- Added `lib/contract-docs.ts` which exports ready‑to‑use typed instances `posts`, `likes`, etc.
- Refactored `post-service` to use typed `posts` (index‑safe queries) and `posts.get`; creation now uses `posts.create` with `keyManager`.
- Migrated `like-service` to typed `likes` for query/create and safe delete.

Scope (demo-ready)
- Persist likes/unlikes and reflect accurate counts/initial state for current user.
- Create posts and replies reliably; show reply counts and a simple thread view.
- Handle transient Dash Platform issues with friendly feedback; avoid hard failures.

Plan
1) Wire Like/Unlike to backend
   - Pass `currentUserId` through `Post` → `PostCard`.
   - In `PostCard.handleLike`, call `likeService.likePost/unlikePost(currentPostId, currentUserId)` with optimistic UI and rollback on error.
   - Disable like when unauthenticated; show toast prompting login.
   - Invalidate stats cache for the post on success (delete `post:stats` key or tag) so future queries reflect updates.

2) Load initial liked state per post
   - In `PostCard`, if `currentUserId` exists, call `likeService.isLiked(post.id, currentUserId)` on mount and set local `liked` state.
   - Optional: batch per viewport page to limit requests; acceptable to keep per-post for demo.

3) Fix reply count accuracy
   - Update `postService.countReplies` to query with a higher limit (e.g., 200) and return length; note limitation if more than the limit.
   - Invalidate `post:stats` for the parent post on successful reply creation so feeds refresh correctly.

4) Add basic Post Detail with thread
   - New route `app/posts/[id]/page.tsx` that fetches the post via `postService.get(id)` and its replies via `postService.getReplies(id)`.
   - Include compose box to reply in-line; reuse `ComposeModal` or add a compact in-page composer.

5) Improve enrichment and reactivity (minimal, demo-safe)
   - After successful like/unlike and reply, update the in-memory post object and emit a `post-updated` event to re-render visible posts.
   - Defer deeper refactor of async enrichment in `postService` until after demo.

6) Validation
   - Unit: extend `like-service.test.ts` with unlike/duplicate-like paths and error rollbacks.
   - Add `post-service` tests for `getReplies/countReplies` simple cases.
   - E2E (happy path): create post → like/unlike → reply; verify counts/visibility and toasts. Mark as flaky-ok for network timeouts with graceful fallbacks.

Risks and Mitigations
- DAPI timeouts: existing retry/toasts in `ComposeModal` and trusted SDK config help; treat confirmation as optimistic where needed.
- Stats lag: use cache invalidation and optimistic increments for immediate UX; background refresh syncs real values.
- Index constraints: type‑safe queries now prevent non‑indexed where clauses at compile time (e.g., `primaryHashtag` is not queryable until indexed).

Acceptance Criteria
- Users can post, like/unlike, and reply; actions persist on refresh.
- Feed shows updated like counts; likes modal lists users correctly.
- Post detail shows replies in chronological order with working inline reply.

Ownership and Sequence
- Services: like/unlike wiring + stats invalidation (DONE). Next: migrate `repost-service`, `bookmark-service`, `follow-service` to typed documents.
- UI: pass `currentUserId`, wire handlers, add post-detail route.
- Tests/E2E: cover happy-path flows; mark known network flakiness.

Previous: Coverage Improvement Plan (for reference)

Goal: Achieve at least 30% statements/lines per module (file-level) across targeted source areas. Use unit tests (Vitest) for lib/** and services, and e2e (Playwright) for pages/components.

Scope and thresholds
- Targeted paths: app/**/*.tsx, components/**/*.tsx, lib/**/*.ts, contexts/**/*.tsx, hooks/**/*.ts/tsx.
- Minimum baseline: 30% statements and lines per targeted area; improve branches/functions opportunistically.

Phase 1 — Services (fast wins)
- identity-service: add tests to cover identity fetch success/failure paths and mapping.
- key-manager: cover store/retrieve/clear flows, TTL behavior, and persistBiometric flag.
- document-service: cover cache invalidation on create/update/delete and get/query happy paths (mock wasm SDK + state transitions).

Phase 2 — Profile flows
- profile-service: tests for updateProfile with avatar create/update/delete, tag invalidation, and getProfilesByIdentityIds batching.

Phase 3 — UI via E2E
- app/feed and components: add a refresh interaction and empty/loading checks (already partially covered); extend to settings and profile scaffolds to tick lines on pages/components.

Validation & iteration
- After each phase, run `npm run coverage:all` and validate each module (file) is ≥30% statements/lines. Add targeted tests for any below-threshold modules.

Expected-failure tests
- Add “guidance” tests for missing or future functionality and mark them appropriately so the suite reflects reality without going red:
  - Vitest: use `test.fails(...)` or `test.todo(...)` to mark expected failures or planned work.
  - Playwright: use `test.fail(true, 'reason')` or `test.fixme(...)` for known-gaps (e.g., authenticated posting flow on testnet).

Current status (baseline before changes)
- Combined (filtered to app code):
  - Statements: ~30.6%
  - Lines: ~33.9%
- Low modules identified:
  - lib/identity-service.ts: ~6.6% lines
  - lib/key-manager.ts: ~23.4% lines
  - lib/services/profile-service.ts: ~34% lines (ok for baseline but will improve in Phase 2)
  - lib/services/document-service.ts: ~48% lines (ok baseline; add invalidation tests)

Progress update (after Phase 1)
- Added tests:
  - identity-service: fetch, balance, verifyIdentity error, getPublicKeys error.
  - key-manager: store/get/clear flows and custom provider.
  - document-service: create/update/delete invalidation.
- New combined coverage (source-only):
  - Statements: ~35.1%
  - Lines: ~38.9%
- Remaining low areas to address (below 30%):
  - wasm-sdk-service.ts (0% — future work; more complex to mock end-to-end).
  - profile-service.ts avatar update/remove paths (lines ~34% — already >=30, but we’ll add a couple tests in Phase 2 to stabilize).

Next actions
4) Add profile-service avatar create/update/delete tests (Phase 2)
5) Re-run coverage and finalize plan; optionally skip wasm-sdk-service for now if aggregate modules remain ≥30%
